    "- **Improving Image Classification Performance**: AlexNet aimed to outperform existing models on image classification benchmarks, particularly the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leveraging GPU Computing for Training**: Training deep neural networks requires significant computational resources. AlexNet was one of the first models to effectively leverage GPUs for training, which drastially reduced training time and enabled the exploration of deeper and more complex models\n",
