# Data Science Learning ðŸ“ŠðŸš€
Welcome to my Data Science repository, where I document my learnings through this dynamic field. Here, you'll find a collection of code snippets, projects and explorations in various programming languages, including Python, R and SQL. This repository is a living document, continuously updated as I delve deeper into the world of Data Science

## ðŸ“š Learning Resources
- Simple yet insightful code examples
- Engaging projects to apply theoretical knowledge
- Explorations into new programming languages

## ðŸ“‹ Interesting projects
- [Simple Linear Algebra Calculator](https://github.com/thomazcabral/Data_Science/blob/3837a7b27dec5c3478b171a9666989353ac752bb/Data%20Science%20with%20Python/C1%20(Introduction%20to%20Data%20Science%20in%20Python)/W1%20(Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python)/A1/linear_algebra_calc.py)
, which helped me get familiarized with array manipulation in the Python numPy library as well as reminding me some crucial concepts of Linear Algebra, which has many applications in Computer Science and Data Science.
